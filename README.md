# Approximate-Adaptive-Kernel-PCA
 
For decreasing the feature vector dimensions, the idea of kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) can be applied for mapping of the features to a non-linear feature space. 

A major disadvantage of KPCA is that the parameters of kernel must be learned by grid search and tuning to get a better performance. So, a dynamic version of KPCA is used for solving this problem and the result is found iteratively using an approximate result to obtain the analytical solution in closed form.
